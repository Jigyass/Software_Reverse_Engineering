HW6 Notes:
Goal: Get further practice with reverse engineering binaries.

1. bin1
   Goal is to determine or guess the password.
   Execution Format: $ ./bin1 <password>
   Correct output: "password OK"

2. bin2
   Goal is to get the program to reveal the "flag".
   Note that this is a 32-bit x86 program.
   Execution format: $ ./bin2
   Desired output: "flag{......}"
