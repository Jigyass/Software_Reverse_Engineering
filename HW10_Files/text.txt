1. #### A1 ####


1. Use ghidra or objdump to inspect the code.


2. We can see that at address 0x00100708 contains the hex encoded instruction loading the value which is eventually being passed to the pow() call.


3. Use a hex editor to edit the hex encoding from c7 45 f8 0a 00 00 00 to [c7 45 f8 06 00 00 00]


#### A2 ####


1. Similarly, inspect binary code to check where the string is being accessed.


2. The string is being accessed at 0x001007e8, verify the string by matching "Hello to Reverse Engineering" with its hex values.


3. Since it matches, we overwrite the address with hex value of "ctf{Updated_String}".


#### A3 ####


1. Similar to A2, we overwrite the address 0x001007e8 hex encode to "New String" equivalent hex values.

1. We need to create the .so file, using the command " gcc -fpic -shared -o libs.so Override.c "


2. Once, we create this shared object, we need to use LD_PRELOAD to make sure that our function definitions are found first, so we run the binary using "LD_PRELOAD=./libs.so ./bin1 4343"
