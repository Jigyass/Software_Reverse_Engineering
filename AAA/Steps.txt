5. If binary is stripped, check for call to a main function <__libc_start_main@plt>(address loaded in rdi)
6. Run "objdump -D --demangle $progname > $progname.txt" 
7. Attempt to interpret the starting of the assembly code
8. Run "gdb ./$progname" to run program with some information to capture the flag
9. Use gdb commands to find the flag
