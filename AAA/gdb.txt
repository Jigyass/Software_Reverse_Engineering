    break ___ - Sets a breakpoint at ___.
    Usage: break main or break *0xADDR
    This command is used to pause the execution of the program at the start of a function or a specific memory address.

    ni (next instruction) - Executes the next machine instruction, but treats function calls as a single instruction.
    Usage: ni
    Useful for stepping over function calls without going into them.

    si (step instruction) - Executes the next machine instruction and steps into function calls.
    Usage: si
    Allows you to inspect the execution of each instruction, including entering function calls.

    layout asm - Displays the assembly code of the current function.
    Usage: layout asm
    This command is useful for visualizing the assembly instructions the program counter (PC) is executing.

    info registers - Displays the current values of all registers.
    Usage: info registers
    Essential for understanding the current state of the CPU registers.

    x/FORMAT ADDRESS - Examine memory at a given address.
    Usage: x/10wx $esp
    This command allows you to inspect memory contents. The format can be specified to view the memory in various data types and sizes (e.g., hexadecimal, words).

    disassemble FUNCTION or disas FUNCTION - Disassembles the machine code of a given function into assembly instructions.
    Usage: disassemble main
    Provides a view of the assembly instructions that make up a function.

    set disassembly-flavor FLAVOR - Sets the disassembly syntax (e.g., intel or att).
    Usage: set disassembly-flavor intel
    Changes the syntax of the displayed assembly code, depending on your preference.

    info functions - Lists all the functions in the program.
    Usage: info functions
    Helps in identifying the functions available for analysis within the binary.

    c (continue) - Continues running the program until the next breakpoint.
    Usage: c
    This command is used to resume the execution of the program after it has been stopped.

    finish - Runs until the current function is finished.
    Usage: finish
    Useful for executing the rest of the function without stepping through each instruction.

    info breakpoints - Lists all current breakpoints.
    Usage: info breakpoints
    Shows the breakpoints you have set, along with their state and location.
