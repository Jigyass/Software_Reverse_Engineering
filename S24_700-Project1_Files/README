Project 1: This project is only for students in the 700 section of this
class.

For this project, your task is to write a program that can do the following.
The program should run on the EECS "cycle" servers. I will test your program
on one of those machines.

All relevant information about the ELF binary layout with useful structure
definitions, etc. are in the manual page for "elf". You can get the elf
manual from the Linux command-line using:
$ man elf

Alternatively, the "elf" manual is available here:
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/elf.5.html

Program tasks:
    Recognize whether the given file is a 64-bit ELF-binary and then identify
    the "Machine" and "Entry point address".
    Print an error message if the file given is not a 64-bit ELF Linux
    binary.
    Examine the section information, and print relevant information about
    each section.
