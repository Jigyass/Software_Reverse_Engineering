You are given three binary executables. You can run all the binaries. All the
binaries are stripped.

Although stripped, advanced RE tools still do a good job of finding the
function boundaries. Since symbols are unavailable, the RE tools assign
'some' names to each function.
Also remember that the code is typically present in the .text section,
read-only data like constant string values are present in the .rodata
section, and global variables are present in the .data section.

You may use any available static or dynamic tool at your disposal. You are
also allowed to manipulate the binary files or update dynamic program state
as you see fit to achieve your goals for this homework.

Good luck!
